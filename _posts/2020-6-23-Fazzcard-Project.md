### Background

In 2019, Payfazz want to create pilot project that separated with recent application. Because of we donâ€™t have top-up license yet, so we think how user can save their balance without using top-up. So we try with cashback method. Challenges that we met when doing this project were: complicated bussiness process; because there were so many merchants that join bussiness with us, and various campaign programs made it more complicated for us. During the progress, we have done various design sprints and technical meeting to align requirements and flows in application.
