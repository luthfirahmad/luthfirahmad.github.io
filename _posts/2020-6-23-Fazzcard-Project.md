### Background

In 2019, Payfazz want to create pilot project that separated with recent application. Because of we donâ€™t have top-up license yet, so we think how user can save their balance without using top-up. So we try with cashback method. Challenges that we met when doing this project were: complicated bussiness process; because there were so many merchants that join bussiness with us, and various campaign programs made it more complicated for us. During the progress, we have done various design sprints and technical meeting to align requirements and flows in application.

### Method

We use **Design Sprint** method.

After heard about requirement and project goal. Our design team invite engineer and product team to discuss about flow feature. We present our low fidelity prototype to them, to check possibilities whether engineer team can make it or not.
After we agreed to fixed flow, we create high fidelity prototype and tested it to our participants according proto-persona that already defined before we deliver to engineer team.
