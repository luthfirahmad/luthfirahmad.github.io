### Background

In 2019, Payfazz want to create pilot project that separated with recent application. Because of we don’t have top-up license yet, so we think how user can save their balance without using top-up. So we try with cashback method. Challenges that we met when doing this project were: complicated bussiness process; because there were so many merchants that join bussiness with us, and various campaign programs made it more complicated for us. During the progress, we have done various design sprints and technical meeting to align requirements and flows in application.

### Challenge

1. There are few apps that have bussiness process like us, so it's a challenge how we benchmarking our product with available products in the market.
2. Vary users target made us difficult to define user persona, in early sprint we just came with proto-persona.
3. Many merchants with various regulations also became hidrance for our business process. So we adjust our needs with them in order to get win win solution for both parties.

### Method

We use **Design Sprint** method.

After heard about requirement and project goal. Our design team invite engineer and product team to discuss about flow feature. We present our low fidelity prototype to them, to check possibilities whether engineer team can make it or not.
After we agreed to fixed flow, we create high fidelity prototype and tested it to our participants according proto-persona that already defined before we deliver to engineer team.

In testing session, we use **guerilla and five seconds test**.

### Learnings

1. In this project, i have learned to became UX Designer as a professional for the first time. I also learned how to used design system and made feasible designs for engineer, but not only that, i also learned how to tested and researched those designs.

2. **Get early feedbacks**, doing design sprint make us got feedback from initial phase. This is important, because with that we can align our design with product requirements.

3. **Test as soon as possible**, we make good and intuitive design, but if it can’t ease user’s experience then it was wasteful, both resource and time. So before we handed it over to developer, we test our design to targeted participants. 

In the end of the day, our team was succeeded to released this project in Playstore and Appstore.
