------

I am using design thinking process to all my projects,

**Define**

Let’s talk what do you need in your project. Your scope project, the requirements and how long the time needed to be done. After you specified you scope and requirements, i usually gather data to support the requirements. User interview, survey, and competitive analysis are the methods that i usually use in this step.

**Ideate**

After defined the problems, i make the solution for it. This can be a low-fidelity mockups or conceptual flow. We can make peer review in this stage if you don’t satisfied with my solution.

**Design**

After we agreed with the concept, i can start design for you. I make high-fidelity design with pixel perfect on it. I will deliver the progress whenever you need it, as soon as possible.

**Testing**

I will test the design to targeted user, make sure the design works well to them.

## Why You Must Hiring Me?

1. **On Time Deliveries**

   I always respect our agreement and try to deliver the designs before deadline as soon as possible.

2. **Collaborative**

   I am a team player man, so i usually collaborate with the team if there is any problem during the design process or when trying to implement solution to a project. So we can discuss the possibilities and technical challenge when implementing it. My actions were based to mutual agreements between me and the clients.
   
3. **Communicative**

   I can clearly convey the solution to the team and explain the plans that will be carried out to achieve it.
