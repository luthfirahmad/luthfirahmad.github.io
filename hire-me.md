I am using design thinking process to all my projects,

### Define

Let’s talk what do you need in your project. Your scope project, the requirements and how long the time needed to be done.

## Why You Must Hiring Me?

1. **On Time Deliveries**

   I always respect our agreement and try to deliver the designs before deadline as soon as possible.

2. **Collaborative**

   I am a team player man, so i usually collaborate with the team if there is any problem during the design process or when trying to implement solution to a project. So we can discuss the possibilities and technical challenge when implementing it. My actions were based to mutual agreements between me and the clients.
   
3. **Communicative**

   I can clearly convey the solution to the team and explain the plans that will be carried out to achieve it.
